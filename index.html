<h6>My favourite Place : Kerala</h6>

<p><b>Kerala</b> is referred to as "<b>God's Own Country</b>." 
    one of my favorite dishes has been the <b>Putta (coconut rice)</b> with squashed bananas, which is a popular breakfast option. 
    A <b>banana leaf</b> is used to serve a <b>traditional Kerala meal</b>. 
    The scenery is stunning, and the environment is spotless! 
    Traveling through Kerala is like walking into a tropical paradise for me because <b>I love nature</b>. 
    I highly recommend a trip to <b>Munnar's</b> tea plantations. 
    This region's rolling hills will make you never want to leave Kerala â€“ <b>everything is green</b>!</p>
