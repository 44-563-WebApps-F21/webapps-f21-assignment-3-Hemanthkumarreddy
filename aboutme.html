  <h3>All for one</h3>
  <p>I was born into a world where nations compete for supremacy with their superpowers. 
    As a result, I was one of them. 
    My superpowers consist of appropriating other people's superpowers and claiming them as my own. 
    I have a variety of superpowers, like airstroke, splitting, teleportation, and the ability to spew both ice and fire at the same time, among others. 
    The more extraordinary powers I obtain, the worse my health becomes. 
    For the time being, I'm looking for a superpower that will restore my damaged cells and allow me to be the most powerful person on this planet.</p>
